A lot of times, kids seem sick, but you donâ€™t know if it's just a GPâ€™s job or a surgeon's. Some red flags:

Persistent belly pain or swelling

Vomiting bile (green) or refusing feeds

Hard groin swelling (inguinal hernia)

Undescended testicle in baby boys

Birth defects like cleft lip, clubfoot, etc.

Recurrent urinary infections or constipation

Severe injuries (fall, burns)

These kids should be checked by a pediatric surgeonâ€”they know kids better than adult surgeons and are trained to operate more safely on tiny bodies. The Care and Cure Multispeciality Hospital pediatric surgeons can diagnose early, treat congenital or acquired surgical issues, and help recovery with minimal discomfort.
